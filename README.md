# glfw-rs

[GLFW3](https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw) binding for [Rust](https://github.com/mozilla/rust). Based on alegalle's [rust_glfw](https://github.com/alegalle/rust_glfw) bindings, but heavily modified to work with the latest development versions of GLFW https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw and Rust.

Please let me know if you have any issues!
