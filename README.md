# glfw-rs

**Warning, these bindings are currently in development, they probably won't work for you!**

[GLFW3](https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw) binding for [Rust](https://github.com/mozilla/rust). Based on alegalle's [rust_glfw](https://github.com/alegalle/rust_glfw) bindings, but heavily modified to work with the latest development versions of GLFW and Rust.
